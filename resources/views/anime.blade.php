    <p>Based on the popular South Korean web novel, Solo Leveling is set in a fantasy world where super-powered warriors known as hunters battle against supernatural creatures who have descended upon Earth en masse to wreak havoc and destruction. The series follows Sung Jin-woo, an infamously low-level hunter, who is inexplicably granted a mysterious power known as “The System” which allows him to amass power without any limit. After becoming the strongest hunter in the world, Jin-woo finds himself caught between two factions vying for the future of the world. A-1 Pictures (Kaguya-Sama: Love is War, Nier: Automata Ver1.1a) will be producing the anime with Shunsuke Nakashige (Sword Art Online: Alicization — War of Underworld) attached as director and Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan) as composer.</p>

    <p>Based on Ryōko Kui’s fantasy comedy manga, Delicious in Dungeon follows a group of intrepid adventurers who descend into the bowels of an ancient labyrinth in search of gold and glory. After being defeated by a powerful red dragon, the remaining party members — human swordsman Laios, halfling locksmith Chilchuck, and elven spellcaster Marcille — reconvene to venture back into the dungeon to save Laios’ sister Falin. There’s just one problem: They have no money and nothing to eat. Enter Senshi, a dwarven warrior with a knack for cooking the many monsters and creatures that live in the dungeon’s depths, who agrees to help the party rescue Falin in exchange for the chance to eat the red dragon. Directed by Yoshihiro Miyajima (Little Witch Academia, JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind), Delicious in Dungeon is being produced by Trigger, the anime studio behind Kill La Kill, Little Witch Academia, and most recently Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, which earned a place on our list of the best anime of 2022.</p>
